<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

During the 2019th edition of the [HITW hackathon](http://www.hackinthewoods.be/), we decided to work on a project for Natagora to aid the organization and their various volunteers in better managing the equipment used to analyze bat population in Belgium.

We thus created **Batman**, a React web application allowing the volunteers to see a map of the past and present location of the trackers as well as to upload and download the audio files collected by these trackers.

### Built With
You will find herebelow the frameworks and dependencies used by this solution:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) with [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
